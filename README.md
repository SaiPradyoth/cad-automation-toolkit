# CAD Automation Toolkit

A Python-based project to explore **CAD workflow automation**.  
This toolkit is being developed as part of my engineering portfolio to show how **software can accelerate product design, validation, and manufacturing**.

## ✨ Features (Planned)
- **Parametric Part Generation** – Create CAD models from JSON/CSV inputs.  
- **Tolerance Stack-Up Analysis** – Automate GD&T calculations.  
- **Batch Export** – Export to STEP, IGES, and DXF in one go.  
- **Validation Integration** – Connect with FEA tools (ABAQUS/ANSYS) for stress & thermal analysis.
